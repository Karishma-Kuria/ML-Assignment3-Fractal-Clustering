Project Statement: </br>

Football also known as soccer in various countries is a very popular game worldwide. In the mid nineteenth century football arose in England. FIFA (Federation Internationale Football Association) was founded in 1904. FIFA serves as the international body governing football for both men and women. According to FIFA, it has 300,000 clubs with around 240 million players.</br>

Opportunity to work with a large database of football data is the driving factor of the project. The database used in this project is collected from various sports news channels like BBC, ESPN and also includes data collected from data scraping in web.</br>

In this collab, I have explored various data mining techniques, which includes visualization, Exploratory data analysis of the dataset. I have applied various Machine learning algorithms to discover existing insights from the data.</br>

The dataset contains details of 9,074 games, totaling 941,009 events which were played in the biggest 5 European football leagues: Spain, England, Germany, Italy, France from 2011/2012 season to 2016/2017 season as of 25.01.2017.</br>
The dataset contains 3 files:</br>
1. dictionary.txt</br>
2. events.csv</br>
3. ginf.csv</br>
</br>
We will be covering the analysis mentioned below, by using the best classifier and compare the performance using matrix and make predictions.</br>
1. Which are the best finishing players?</br>
2. Analyzing the number of Goals Scored?</br>
3. Analyzing when to make Substitutions?</br>
4. Analyzing the number of Yellow/Red Cards?</br>
5. Analyzing number of Penalties?</br>
6. Which players will score the most “expected goals”?</br>
7. Which players are the worst decision maker in their shots?</br>
8. Which players makes the most/best dangerous passes?</br>
9. Which are the popular teams and their style of play?</br>
10. Which are the weak teams, analysis using Clustering?</br>

Objective functions </br>
1. Making clusters of teams based on the **Fouls Commited** and **Goals Scored** by the teams. </br>
2. Identify top 3 teams based on the performance in the matches taking into consideration the Fouls Commited and Goals Scored.</br>
3. Identify the worst performing teams based on the **Fouls Commited** and Goals Scored.</br>
